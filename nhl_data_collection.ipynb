    "# NHL 2024-25 Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook retrieves game and player statistics from the National Hockey League's 2024-25 season using the official NHL web API (`api-web.nhle.com`).  The goal is to produce clean, structured data sets that can be used for predictive modelling.  The notebook performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scrape schedule:** Generate a list of all regular-season game IDs and basic game information (date, teams, scores, home/away).  The NHL API exposes a schedule endpoint that can be queried by date.  We iterate over every date in the season to build a full schedule.  The API\u2019s season endpoints return JSON describing the games, including home/away teams, game ID and final score\u3010591982464243434\u2020L0-L17\u3011.\n",
    "* **Download boxscores:** For each game ID we query the NHL \"gamecenter\" endpoint, which returns a detailed boxscore that includes player statistics for both teams.  This endpoint groups players by position (forwards, defence and goalies) and provides stats such as goals, assists, points, shots, hits, penalty minutes and time-on-ice\u3010131195590886814\u2020L280-L307\u3011.\n",
    "* **Build player-game table:**  We flatten the boxscore JSON into a table where each row corresponds to a single player's performance in a single game.  The table includes the player's ID, name, position, team, game ID, date and all available statistics.  Players not dressed for the game (scratches) are also recorded when the information is present in the boxscore.\n",
    "* **Build game-team table:**  We derive a simpler table where each row corresponds to a team in a given game, capturing final score, home/away flag, starting goalie and counts of scratches.  This makes it easy to join player-level data with team outcomes later.\n",
    "* **Save data:**  Both tables are saved to disk (CSV or Parquet) so that they can be reused without re-scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook relies on the open NHL API described in a recent technical article\u3010131195590886814\u2020L280-L307\u3011 and on the TopDownHockey scraper documentation for context\u3010430751149834465\u2020L264-L306\u3011.  You will need an active internet connection when running the code because it queries the NHL servers.\n"
